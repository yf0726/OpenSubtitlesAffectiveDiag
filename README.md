Movie Dialog Dataset

**Movie DiC Corpus** contains about 130,000 dialogues and 6 million words from movie scripts extracted from the Internet Movie Script Data Collection. One derivation based on this corpus is the Movie Triples Dataset (Serban et al., 2016). There is also the American Film Scripts Corpus and Film Scripts Online Corpus which form the Film Scripts Online Series Corpus, which can be pur- chased. 


**Filtered Movie Script Corpus**, takes over 1 million utterance-response pairs from web- based script resources and filters them down to 86,000 such pairs. The filtering method limits the extracted utterances to X-Y-X triples, where X is spoken by the same actor and each of the utterance share some semantic similarity. These triples are then decomposed into X-Y and Y-X pair.
