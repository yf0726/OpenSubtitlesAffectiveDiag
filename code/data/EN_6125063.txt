Land ... that's what I do .<EOS>Buy land ... lots of it .<EOS>Then construct apartments , condos ... the house of your dreams .<EOS>That's my job . That's what I do .<EOS>My name is Thomas Fiorini .<EOS>I own and operate one of the largest construction and development companies in upstate New York .<EOS>Became filthy rich doing so .<EOS>People ask me all the time ,<EOS>' How did you do it ? ' or ' What's your secret ? '<EOS>I say , ' People skills . '<EOS>You have to know how to communicate , 'cause you're gonna meet all kinds .<EOS>I got a deadline , all right ? You're holding people up .<EOS>I gotta get this shit done ! You're not my boss .<EOS>Yeah , well , I'm Tony's boss , so , get it done .<EOS>Stop fucking around with me .<EOS>Stop being a fucking asshole !<EOS>
It's given me a great life .<EOS>I have all the toys and vacation homes .<EOS>I do what I want when I want .<EOS>Pretty much do n't have to answer to nobody .<EOS>My wife just became pregnant , which sounds like a lot of extra work and inconveniences for me ... but I'm game . And how hard can it be ?<EOS>
Seriously , she's crazy about me .<EOS>Can n't keep her hands off me .<EOS>Really can n't blame her . I mean , look at me .<EOS>I got it all .<EOS>Oh , did I mention I was filthy rich ?<EOS>And she's a monster in the sack .<EOS>Just the way I like it .<EOS>Life's perfect .<EOS>Nothings wrong , right ?<EOS>
So let me ask you something .<EOS>How did I wind up here ?<EOS>I mean ... how the fuck did I get like this ?<EOS>
Never mind !<EOS>My name is Matt Miller ,<EOS>Thomas Fiorini's head foreman .<EOS>I work ten hours a day , six days a week , and physically bust my ass .<EOS>I spend my days managing crack-heads for employees , film complaints from soccer moms who want it , and kiss the ass of an irrational dick for a boss who'd replace me in a second with an illegal Mexican .<EOS>And for what ?<EOS>A shit bonus at the end of the year ?<EOS>
That's my daughter , Crystal .<EOS>Beautiful , is n't she ?<EOS>Wish I could say the same about my wife .<EOS>We fell out of love about five years ago .<EOS>I mean , look at her .<EOS>I guess that's what happens in life sometimes .<EOS>
Forget about your dreams , and who you were , and just accept that this is it .<EOS>Stuck in a life you never wanted .<EOS>
Can I get you anything else ?<EOS>
Thank you .<EOS>

Do n't worry about it .<EOS>
So after the first attack , uh , that was a Friday , and I came back to work on Monday and I was looking for him , and he was missing .<EOS>Bricker called me at home and he was real threatening .<EOS>Being a real wise prick , and ...<EOS>
And then , uh , that was it .<EOS>
He's still threatening me . I was home .<EOS>He called me one night , was talking a lot of shit .<EOS>And after he attacked , uh , Matt on Friday ...<EOS>I came on Monday .<EOS>
Tony was on the site and fucking Matt was missing .<EOS>Okay .<EOS>
We'll put that in the report .<EOS>We filed a complaint against Tony with his parole officer yesterday about him threatening you .<EOS>We'll let him know about this also .<EOS>He's meeting her at , what , two o 'clock today ?<EOS>Yeah .<EOS>Uh , so what happens after , uh , his parole officer gives him a warning ?<EOS>
Huh ?<EOS>I mean , what's ... What's your next move ?<EOS>Like my partner said , we'll ... We'll put in the report .<EOS>And that's it ?<EOS>
Right now , it is .<EOS>I mean , we can n't arrest him on a threat , if that's what you're asking .<EOS>
I do n't know . I mean , it sounds like you guys are protecting him .<EOS>What do you mean by that ?<EOS>I come in here , I tell you about a convicted felon who's threatening me and my wife ... and my foreman is missing , and both of you's are laughing at me ?<EOS>Whoa ... Oh , whoa .<EOS>

Where were you yesterday , Tom ?<EOS>I was in the city .<EOS>New York ? <EOS>Yeah .<EOS>Something special about that ?<EOS>Something special about that ?<EOS>
Yes , as a matter of fact , there is something special about that .<EOS>
What part of New York were you in , Tom ?<EOS>I was in the Upper East Side .<EOS>
Let me guess .<EOS>
Visiting family ?<EOS>Yeah ... my wife's mother .<EOS>Mother ?<EOS>
What'd you do ?<EOS>Sat around , ate .<EOS>Talked about the baby coming , that kinda shit .<EOS>What'd you eat ?<EOS>
She made a nice roast .<EOS>Oh , really ?<EOS>Any good ? <EOS>Yeah .<EOS>Tony Bricker was killed yesterday ... sometime in the morning or early afternoon .<EOS>
He was killed , huh ? <EOS>Yeah .<EOS>Reported yesterday morning by Sheriff Biggs .<EOS>Hospital confirmed .<EOS>Any ideas ?<EOS>Not a clue at this point .<EOS>
I seem to recall you coming in here last week to file a complaint against the guy .<EOS>
Now that's making a choice ... junior .<EOS>
I just came by to check things out .<EOS>Check on Tony , like you said .<EOS>I did n't expect to see you here .<EOS>
But I see you took my advice .<EOS>Took matters into your own hands .<EOS>
Where's Liz ?<EOS>Why did you do this now ?<EOS>This is fucking wonderful .<EOS>
I do n't know .<EOS>You did n't kill her , did you ?<EOS>
You do n't understand what this guy did to my wife .<EOS>
All right .<EOS>
Anybody see you ?<EOS>
You sure ?<EOS>You're sure nobody saw you ? 'Cause that's really important .<EOS>
Okay .<EOS>
All right ...<EOS>I'm not saying I'm gonna lose my job over this , but , uh , when I call this in , I fill out that report , your name's not gonna be on it .<EOS>
Now get outta here .<EOS>
Hell of an alibi , though .<EOS>
Why would I need an alibi ?<EOS>
I mean , I'm a home builder , right ?<EOS>
Then I'm the last guy you guys should be looking at .<EOS>All right , you know what ?<EOS>You're taking this the wrong way .<EOS>You're trying to say I killed somebody ?<EOS>No ...<EOS>
Nobody's trying to say you killed anybody .<EOS>Nobody's trying to say you killed Tony .<EOS>
What we're doing is asking you a few questions .<EOS>Doing our job .<EOS>
Do your partner think I killed somebody ?<EOS>I do think you did it .<EOS>
In fact , I , uh ...<EOS>
I know you did it .<EOS>
And when we find what we're looking for ...<EOS>I'm gonna put you away for <NUM> years .<EOS>
Maybe life .<EOS>
