Dr Evil , several years ago ... we invested in a small Seattle-based coffee company .<EOS>Today Starbucks offers premium quality coffee ... at affordable prices .<EOS>De-lish !<EOS>
If we shift our resources ... away from evil empires and towards Starbucks ... we can increase our profits five-fold .<EOS>Number Two , I make the decisions here , OK ?<EOS>I demand a little respect .<EOS>Dr Evil , you have a little of the ...<EOS>Silence !<EOS>I will not tolerate your insolence !<EOS>Frau Farbissina , wie geht es ihnen ?<EOS>Sehr gut , Herr Doktor .<EOS>How are things ?<EOS>I have come to embrace the love that dare not speak its name .<EOS>To my right is my lover .<EOS>We met at the LPGA Tour .<EOS>Her name is Unibrau .<EOS>Right on .<EOS>
Welcome , Unibrau .<EOS>

Except one eighth your size .<EOS>Breathtaking .<EOS>I shall call him ...<EOS>Mini-Me .<EOS>
Your stock is rising , Number Two .<EOS>
Come , Mr Bigglesworth .<EOS>
Mini-Me , are you hungry ?<EOS>Something to eat ?<EOS>Not even a Hot Pocket ?<EOS>
An Eggo ?<EOS>No , we do n't gnaw on our kitty .<EOS>Leave Mini-Mr . Bigglesworth alone .<EOS>Just love him and stroke him .<EOS>
As you know ... every diabolical scheme that I have hatched ... has been thwarted by Austin Powers .<EOS>And why is that , ladies and gentlemen ?<EOS>'Cause you never kill him when you get the chance to ... and you're a big dope .<EOS>
Down , Mini-Me .<EOS>Austin Powers always defeats me because he has mojo .<EOS>Mojo ?<EOS>
The libido . The life force .<EOS>The essence . The right stuff .<EOS>What the French call a certain ...<EOS>I do n't know what .<EOS>Ladies and gentlemen ...<EOS>I've developed a device for travelling through time ... which I call a ' time machine . '<EOS>Using this ' time machine ... '<EOS>I'm going back to the Sixties and steal Austin Powers ' mojo .<EOS>If you have a time machine ... why not just go back and kill Austin Powers ... when he's sitting on the crapper or something ?<EOS>How about no , Scott ?<EOS>OK ?<EOS>Why not use your knowledge of the future ... to play the stock market ?<EOS>We could make trillions .<EOS>Why make trillions when we could make ... billions ?<EOS>
A trillion is more than a billion , numnuts .<EOS>All right , zip it .<EOS>You can n't even<EOS>Zip it .<EOS>Zi-i-i-p .<EOS>Look , all I'm<EOS>-<EOS>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , ex-zip-it ' A. '<EOS>Number Two , would you please back me up ?<EOS>Look , I'm Zippi Longstocking . <EOS>I can n't<EOS>-<EOS>

You're like a child<EOS>-<EOS>
Zip it . Unveil the time portal .<EOS>
As you know ...<EOS>Austin Powers was frozen in <NUM> .<EOS>Therefore , I will travel to <NUM> ... two years after he was frozen .<EOS>He'll be helpless .<EOS>Ladies and gentlemen ...<EOS>I'm about to travel through time .<EOS>I bid you adieu .<EOS>
I'm OK .<EOS>Not turned on , I suppose .<EOS>Do you think you could ...<EOS>Yeah , thanks .<EOS>Come , Mini-Me !<EOS>
Do n't be scared , Mini-Me .<EOS>
Welcome to <NUM> .<EOS>Thank you , Number Two .<EOS>You look so healthy and youthful .<EOS>Well , thank you .<EOS>Herr Doktor .<EOS>And Frau , you look so ...<EOS>
Right .<EOS>I received your memo from the future .<EOS>Your new lair is up and running .<EOS>Is it a hollowed-out volcano like I asked for ?<EOS>Of course .<EOS>Good .<EOS>Then it's all going perfectly to plan .<EOS>
Yeah , baby , yeah !<EOS>
When did you get the Clapper ?<EOS>November <NUM> .<EOS>Dutch East Indies . Shore leave .<EOS>Do you know how we keep warm in Russia ?<EOS>
I can guess , baby .<EOS>We play chess .<EOS>I guessed wrong .<EOS>It takes a keen intellect to play chess .<EOS>I assume you know how to play .<EOS>
Of course , baby .<EOS>
What to do , what to do .<EOS>
Let me ask you a question .<EOS>And be honest .<EOS>Do I make you horny , baby ?<EOS>Do I ?<EOS>Do I make you randy ?<EOS>
No more games .<EOS>Dr Evil sent me here to kill you ... but I find you so ... sexy and ...<EOS>
Just make love to me .<EOS>Now , Austin Powerovich .<EOS>Hurry !<EOS>
You're hairy like animal !<EOS>Grr , baby ! Very grr !<EOS>Make love to me , monkey man .<EOS>Dr Evil , I do n't understand ... how we can hope to steal Austin Powers ' mojo .<EOS>We've tried this before .<EOS>The security around Powers is foolproof .<EOS>But this time we have an operative ... inside the Ministry of Defence .<EOS>Really ?<EOS>Yes , really .<EOS>
He's stealing Austin Powers mojo even as we speak .<EOS>Really ?<EOS>
He's a disgruntled Scottish guard ... known for his lethal temper and his unusual eating habits .<EOS>He weighs a metric ton .<EOS>His name ... Fat Bastard .<EOS>
We've had reports there's a spy in the Ministry of Defence .<EOS>The contents of this room are vital to the country .<EOS>Be on special alert .<EOS>Yes , sir .<EOS>And try to lose some weight , for God's sake .<EOS>
Mr English colonel telling me to lose weight .<EOS>I'm a hard case , he says .<EOS>Well , listen up , sonny Jim ...<EOS>I ate a baby !<EOS>Oh , aye , baby . The other other white meat .<EOS>Baby : It's what's for dinner .<EOS>
I've got your mojo now , sonny Jim .<EOS>
What's wrong ?<EOS>Crikey !<EOS>I've lost my mojo .<EOS>
Austin , the test results confirm ... that you've lost your mojo ... and it could n't come at a worse time .<EOS>We have evidence that Dr Evil has developed a time machine ... and has travelled back to the year <NUM> .<EOS>Luckily , we , too ... have developed a time travel device ... to transport you back to the Sixties .<EOS>This is where you input your destination .<EOS>Wait a tick .<EOS>Basil , if I travel back to <NUM> and I was frozen in <NUM> ... presumably , I could go visit my frozen self .<EOS>But if I'm still frozen in <NUM> ... how could I have been unthawed ... in the Nineties and travelled back<EOS>-<EOS>Oh , no , I've gone cross-eyed .<EOS>I suggest you do n't worry about this sort of thing ... and just enjoy yourself .<EOS>That goes for you all , too .<EOS>
This is smashing , Basil .<EOS>I go back to the Sixties , recharge my mojo ... defeat Dr Evil , and be back in time for tea .<EOS>Swinging Sixties , here I come , baby , yeah !<EOS>Move ! Move !<EOS>
Sorry .<EOS>I bet that's expensive .<EOS>
Sorry .<EOS>Easy !<EOS>Stop it now , Austin !<EOS>Here we go .<EOS>Yeah , baby , yeah !<EOS>Godspeed , Austin Powers .<EOS>
I'm home !<EOS>
I'm back in the Sixties , baby , yeah !<EOS>
Get your hands off my Heine , baby .<EOS>
Who are you today , baby ?<EOS>My name is Robin Swallows .<EOS>Swallows . That's an interesting name .<EOS>Maiden name's Spitz .<EOS>Which is it , baby , Spitz or Swallows ?<EOS>
Those are skin tight .<EOS>How do you get into those pants , baby ?<EOS>You can start by buying me a drink .<EOS>
I want ! I want !<EOS>
Better play it cool . Your friend works for Dr Evil .<EOS>And just who do you work for , baby ?<EOS>
Tell me , Mr Powers ... do you swing ?<EOS>Are you kidding , baby ?<EOS>I put the ' Grr ! ' ing swinger , ' baby !<EOS>
Then why do n't you come right ... over here .<EOS>I can do that .<EOS>
Prepare to die , Powers !<EOS>
Use the machine gun !<EOS>
Say goodbye , Powers !<EOS>
Use the bazooka !<EOS>
The fall will kill us both , Powers !<EOS>
You can n't win , Powers .<EOS>
Why wo n't you die ?<EOS>
Care for a ride ?<EOS>
Go !<EOS>
Austin Powers , I presume .<EOS>Powers by name , Powers by reputation .<EOS>Felicity Shagwell , CIA .<EOS>Shagwell by name ... shag-very-well by reputation .<EOS>Oh , behave !<EOS>Not if I can help it .<EOS>
You know what's remarkable is how much England ... looks in no way like Southern California .<EOS>
Crikey !<EOS>We've got company ! Looks like one of Dr Evil's assassins .<EOS>
Steady now .<EOS>Hands up !<EOS>Do you remember me , Austin Powers ?<EOS>I do n't recall your name but your ... fez is familiar .<EOS>
My name is Mustafa .<EOS>And I'm the man who will be killing you now .<EOS>Daktari !<EOS>
Who sent you ?<EOS>You'll have to kill me .<EOS>Who sent you ?<EOS>Kiss my ass , Powers .<EOS>Who sent you ?<EOS>Dr Evil .<EOS>
That was easy . <EOS>That was .<EOS>Why did you tell us ?<EOS>I can n't stand to be asked the same question three times .<EOS>It just irritates me .<EOS>Where is Dr Evil hiding ?<EOS>Why would he tell me ?<EOS>I'm just one of his low-level functionaries .<EOS>Where is Dr Evil hiding ?<EOS>You'll have to torture me . I'll never tell you .<EOS>Where is Dr Evil hiding ? <EOS>Damn ! Three times .<EOS>He's hiding in the secret volcano lair .<EOS>Where's Dr Evil's secret volcano lair ?<EOS>I spit at the question .<EOS>Do I really have to ask you two more times ?<EOS>Go to hell , Powers !<EOS>Fine . Where is Dr Evil's secret volcano lair ?<EOS>I will take it to the grave with me .<EOS>You have to answer . He asked you three times .<EOS>
The second question was ...<EOS>' Do I really have to ask you two more times ? '<EOS>That would be the first question in a new line of questioning ... and would n't count in the other line of questioning .<EOS>He's right .<EOS>However , I'm just trying to get information from you , man .<EOS>I do n't need any consistency in the questions , do I ?<EOS>No . You're preaching to the converted<EOS>-<EOS>If I'm preaching to the converted ... then why are you being so slavish ... to the three-question form ?<EOS>You're not even looking at me , man .<EOS>Now you're just being rude , you know what I mean ?<EOS>You're not listening , man .<EOS>
Oh , crikey !<EOS>
Well , Austin , I think this time you have finally met your match .<EOS>Oh , no , baby .<EOS>I've beaten Dr Evil before , and I'll beat him again .<EOS>I was talking about me .<EOS>
Hello up there !<EOS>I seem to have fallen down a cliff .<EOS>I'm still alive , but I'm very badly injured .<EOS>I think my legs are broken . I'll try to stand .<EOS>Yes , they are broken .<EOS>Perhaps you could toss me a band-aid ... or some antibacterial cream .<EOS>I'm in an extraordinarily large amount of pain .<EOS>The bone has gone through the skin .<EOS>I fear it might be gangrenous .<EOS>The wound is beginning to smell a little like almonds ... which is not good .<EOS>Please ?<EOS>No one ?<EOS>Sorry .<EOS>I'll try the other leg .<EOS>
Two of my assassins are dead .<EOS>I will not tolerate failure .<EOS>I'm the man who will maintain the dignity ... of this evil organization .<EOS>What the hell was that ?<EOS>Volcanic eruption !<EOS>
May I present to you my spy in the Ministry of Defence ...<EOS>Fat Bastard .<EOS>First things first !<EOS>Where's your shitter ?<EOS>I've got a turtle head poking out .<EOS>
Charming .<EOS>I'm not kidding .<EOS>I got a crap on deck that could choke a donkey .<EOS>It's squidgey !<EOS>Christ , I'm getting all emotional from it , you know ?<EOS>Right .<EOS>Fat Bastard , could I have my mojo , please ?<EOS>Where's my money ?<EOS>All right , give him his money .<EOS>
Jesus Christ , he's tiny !<EOS>I've had bigger chunks of corn in my crap .<EOS>Wait a minute .<EOS>He kinda looks like a baby .<EOS>Come here ! I'm gonna eat you !<EOS>I'm bigger than you .<EOS>I'm higher on the food chain .<EOS>Get in my belly !<EOS>Come on !<EOS>You're lucky , wee man !<EOS>Can I have a hug ?<EOS>
Let me make you a deal , all right ?<EOS>You get the mojo , you keep your money ... and I'll get your baby .<EOS>

One for me ... and one for my homies .<EOS>

When the moon reaches ... its appropriate lunar alignment ... it will destroy Washington D.C.<EOS>You see , I've turned the moon ... into what I like to call a ' Death Star . '<EOS>
What ? <EOS>Nothing , Darth .<EOS>What did you call me ?<EOS>Nothing . Rip-off !<EOS>Bless you .<EOS>Anyways , the key to this plan is the giant laser .<EOS>It was invented by the noted Cambridge physicist Dr Parsons .<EOS>Therefore , we shall call it the Alan Parsons Project .<EOS>Oh , my God .<EOS>What now ?<EOS>The Alan Parsons Project is a progressive rock band in <NUM> .<EOS>Why do n't you just call it ' Operation Wang Chung , ' ass ?<EOS>
I'm sure ' Operation Bananarama ' will be huge .<EOS>What are you saying ?<EOS>lf you wanted<EOS>Shh !<EOS>

You're very shagadelic .<EOS>I just did n't want to fall in love again ... and I thought you'd never love me without my mojo .<EOS>It's not you .<EOS>You're fab , switched on , a bit of all right . Yes !<EOS>That is so great .<EOS>There's something I should tell you , too .<EOS>Last night , I planted a homing device on Fat Bastard .<EOS>Smashing , baby .<EOS>Then we can track down Fat Bastard ... get my mojo , go back to my place ... hop on the good foot and do the bad thing . Yes !<EOS>But there's more .<EOS>In order to get close to Fat Bastard , I had to<EOS>-<EOS>Hello , hello . The signal's coming through .<EOS>He's at Paddington Station .<EOS>Let's go !<EOS>
We're close , baby . <EOS>This way .<EOS>Straight--no , no , left . Through here .<EOS>
We've got him .<EOS>Private , bring up the ram .<EOS>
Go , go , go !<EOS>Where is he ?<EOS>Oh , my God !<EOS>Fat Bastard left a floater !<EOS>In the name of all things sacred ... that is the most foul-smelling thing ever !<EOS>Somebody flush it down !<EOS>No , nobody touch anything .<EOS>We have to get the sample to the lab to be analysed .<EOS>
I'm gonna give .<EOS>
Austin , there you are .<EOS>Has the sample been analysed ?<EOS>Cor , baby . You look very shagadelic !<EOS>
But do we really have to be here , Felicity ?<EOS>I mean , it's so boring .<EOS>I do n't believe in science .<EOS>When it comes to the spy game , to me , it's all instinct .<EOS>
Hello , everybody . <EOS>Hello , Basil .<EOS>The results are in .<EOS>We've discovered trace elements of a rare vegetable ... found only on one island , here , in the Caribbean .<EOS>
What does it all mean , Basil ?<EOS>It means that this is the location of Dr Evil's lair .<EOS>Smashing , Basil .<EOS>Cor ! This coffee smells like shit .<EOS>
It is shit , Austin .<EOS>Oh , good , then it's not just me .<EOS>
It's a bit nutty .<EOS>
Excuse me , Dr Evil .<EOS>I have to speak to you about this Mini-Me .<EOS>He's not fitting in ?<EOS>Is he giving off too much of a creepy Oompa Loompa vibe ?<EOS>No , it's just that he bites .<EOS>
He's a biter .<EOS>
What's wrong , Mini-Me ?<EOS>Something you want to tell us ?<EOS>
Teething .<EOS>
Get me the president of the United States of America !<EOS>Oh , he's on .<EOS>What do you want , Dr Evil ?<EOS>Mr President , in twelve hours ...<EOS>I will destroy Washington D.C. with this giant ' laser . '<EOS>What the<EOS>?<EOS>Mini-Me , stop humping the laser .<EOS>OK , honest to God ... why do n't you and the giant laser get a fricking room ?<EOS>Mr President , after I destroy Washington D.C ...<EOS>I will destroy another major city every hour on the hour .<EOS>That is , unless , of course , you pay me ... one hundred billion dollars .<EOS>
Dr Evil , this is <NUM> .<EOS>That amount of money does n't even exist .<EOS>
That's like saying , ' I want a kajillion bajillion dollars . '<EOS>
Come on , Mr President , show me the money .<EOS>Show you what money ?<EOS>Show me the money , show me the money .<EOS>You had me at hello . Tear . Nothing ? No ?<EOS>Psst ! It's <NUM> .<EOS>' Jerry Maguire ' wo n't come out for another thirty years .<EOS>Nobody knows what you're talking about , ass .<EOS>Scott , Daddy's working , OK ?<EOS>And when you're in the main chamber ... try and use the big boy voice , OK ?<EOS>Thank you .<EOS>
Mr President , allow me to demonstrate ... the awesome lethality of the Alan Parsons Project .<EOS>Fire the laser !<EOS>
Damage report ! Damage report !<EOS>It's OK . It's all right . Come on .<EOS>Actually , that was footage from ' Independence Day ... '<EOS>but the real laser would be a lot like that .<EOS>Yeah , scary .<EOS>
Now , Dr Evil<EOS>-<EOS>Talk to the hand , ' cause the face do n't want to hear it .<EOS>What hand ? Talk to your hand ?<EOS>You aingt all that and a bag of potato chips .<EOS>What are you talking about ?<EOS>Do n't go there , girlfriend .<EOS>Whose girlfriend ?<EOS>Do n't mess with me , I'm one crazy mo-fo .<EOS>I had to pop a cop ... 'cause he was n't giving me my props in Oaktown .<EOS>No ? I heard that somewhere .<EOS>You're an idiot .<EOS>Mr President , I think we have an understanding .<EOS>
Dr Evil , what are our plans regarding Austin Powers ?<EOS>Austin Powers ? He's the snake to my mongoose .<EOS>Or the mongoose to my snake . Either way , it's bad .<EOS>I do n't know animals .<EOS>
This time it's personal .<EOS>Kill him .<EOS>
There's Dr Evil's island .<EOS>
Let's set up camp .<EOS>Be careful with that bag !<EOS>There's explosives in it .<EOS>This could be dangerous .<EOS>
What if God was one of us ?<EOS>
Well done , very good .<EOS>Dr Evil , that was fantastic .<EOS>Thank you , Number Two .<EOS>I wrote that , yeah .<EOS>Dad , he put this in my bed .<EOS>Who ?<EOS>Your stupid mini-you .<EOS>He put road kill in my sheets !<EOS>What--Mini-Me , do n't you ever do that again .<EOS>You hear me , do n't you ever do that again !<EOS>I can n't stay mad at you .<EOS>Look at that punum .<EOS>Dr Evil's headquarters is right over that next ridge .<EOS>Let me look .<EOS>Damn it . How do we get in ?<EOS>Hello , Mummy . Can I have some chocolates ?<EOS>I want some Mars Bars .<EOS>Do n't smack my bottom , Mummy .<EOS>Sorry , love .<EOS>I got stuck in your dirty pillows .<EOS>Let's look at the map .<EOS>
Austin , what's our plan ?<EOS>According to this map ... the entire island is crawling with Dr Evil's guards .<EOS>I want to make sure the explosives did n't get wet ... but I can n't find them .<EOS>Look in the bottom .<EOS>OK , I'll dig a little deeper .<EOS>Wow , this bag is really full .<EOS>
Just keep digging , darling .<EOS>I'll just feel around for them .<EOS>
Good lord , Austin .<EOS>What do you keep in here ?<EOS>Anything that catches my fancy , you know .<EOS>Give it a good tug .<EOS>
Do we really need this ?<EOS>I'll ask you not to open that inside , thank you very much .<EOS>Oh , my God .<EOS>Oops , it went off .<EOS>Yes , it does that from time to time .<EOS>Eww . Yuck .<EOS>Yeah , that's nasty .<EOS>Yeah , sorry about that .<EOS>Smelly .<EOS>These people make me sick .<EOS>Can you snap me a beer ?<EOS>
What is it ?<EOS>It's a gerbil .<EOS>How did that get in your bag ?<EOS>
I do n't know .<EOS>
Dr Evil , we have a problem .<EOS>Austin Powers is on the island .<EOS>Bring him to me ... alive .<EOS>You .<EOS>Hit it !<EOS>This is a very sensitive subject .<EOS>
I knew that I'd be safe 'cause I'd never be alone<EOS>An evil doctor should n't speak aloud about his feelings<EOS>My hurt and my pain do n't make me too appealin'<EOS>I'd hoped Scott would look up to me<EOS>
Return the love I have , make me want to cry<EOS>Be evil , but have my feelings , too<EOS>
But Scott rejected me , c 'est la vie<EOS>Life is cruel , treats you unfairly<EOS>Even so , a God there must be<EOS>Mini-Me , you complete me<EOS>
You've got this packed really tight .<EOS>Are you OK ?<EOS>Yeah , I just got a bit of a back cramp , that's all .<EOS>Just keep packing it in .<EOS>God .<EOS>I found the explosives .<EOS>Help me check them .<EOS>You're surrounded ! Drop your weapons !<EOS>Hands up !<EOS>
Move out !<EOS>
Ladies and gentlemen , in just a few moments ... we're going to place a giant ' laser ' on the moon .<EOS>From my ' Death Star ... '<EOS>I will destroy every city on the planet .<EOS>Get off of me .<EOS>Ah , Mr Powers , Ms Shagwell ... welcome to my hollowed-out volcano .<EOS>This is my associate Fat Bastard .<EOS>Felicity , I think you two may have already ' met . '<EOS>Unfortunately .<EOS>Is that all the thanks I get for the night of hot sex ?<EOS>I'm dead sexy .<EOS>You were crap !<EOS>
In your dreams .<EOS>
Felicity would never sleep with you .<EOS>Right ?<EOS>I did what I had to do .<EOS>I'm a secret agent .<EOS>What ?<EOS>

I'll get you , Dr Evil !<EOS>Look at me , I'm shaking in my little space boots .<EOS>I want my mojo !<EOS>Great plan , Einstein .<EOS>You're gonna put him in a cell with one inept guard ... and they'll escape !<EOS>God , you do this every time !<EOS>You know , Scott ...<EOS>I've been a fricking evil doctor for thirty fricking years , OK ?<EOS>Cut me some fricking slack .<EOS>You forget , Scott , we're in a volcano .<EOS>We're surrounded by liquid hot magma .<EOS>

I just did what I thought you would do in the same situation .<EOS>You're the reason that I became a spy .<EOS>I thought I wanted to be you , but then I realized that ...<EOS>I want to be with you .<EOS>You do ?<EOS>
Hang on , baby .<EOS>Alleyoop !<EOS>We should talk about this later .<EOS>First we need to get past that one inept guard .<EOS>Right , here's the plan .<EOS>What if I pretend to be ill with food poisoning ?<EOS>The guard , drawn by my cries of pain , comes to investigate .<EOS>Meanwhile , you dig a pit ... line it with makeshift punji sticks ... made from sharpened toothbrushes .<EOS>The guard falls in , Bob's your uncle , we escape .<EOS>What do you think ?<EOS>That might work , but what about this ?<EOS>
What do you think of these ?<EOS>Mommy .<EOS>

You did n't answer my question .<EOS>Are you happy ?<EOS>Of course I'm not happy .<EOS>Look at me , I'm a big fat slob .<EOS>I've got bigger titties than you do .<EOS>I've got more chins than a Chinese phone book .<EOS>I've not seen my willie in two years ... which is long enough to declare it legally dead .<EOS>
I can n't stop eating .<EOS>I eat because I'm unhappy .<EOS>
I'm unhappy because I eat .<EOS>It's a vicious cycle .<EOS>If you'll excuse me ... there's someone I have to get in touch with and forgive .<EOS>Myself .<EOS>
Oh , God .<EOS>Sorry , I farted .<EOS>
It's a long road ahead .<EOS>
Who am I kidding ?<EOS>I'm going to kill you anyway .<EOS>Judo chop !<EOS>
Right in the mommy-daddy button !<EOS>That's for calling me crap , you fatty .<EOS>
Listen , baby , I do n't care if he is a Fat Bastard ... you do n't give a man a shot in the pills .<EOS>It's just not cricket .<EOS>Do you think I'll be happy here in the Nineties ?<EOS>Well , I know the Nineties might sound boring ... but as far as I'm concerned ...<EOS>I've brought the best part of the Sixties back with me .<EOS>You .<EOS>Wait a minute .<EOS>Where are you going ?<EOS>
Did we get Dr Evil ?<EOS>No . He got away in that rocket that looks like a huge ...<EOS>Penis .<EOS>The male reproductive organ .<EOS>Also known as tallywhacker , schlong , or ...<EOS>Wiener ?<EOS>Any of you kids want another wiener ?<EOS>Dad , what's that ?<EOS>I do n't know , son , but it's got great big ...<EOS>Nuts ! Hot , salty nuts !<EOS>Who wants some ? Lord almighty !<EOS>That looks just like my husband's ...<EOS>One-eyed monster .<EOS>Step right up and see the one-eyed monster !<EOS>
Hey , what's that ?<EOS>It looks like a big ...<EOS>Woody ! Woody Harrelson ?<EOS>Can I have your autograph ?<EOS>Sure , no problem .<EOS>Oh , my Lord . Look at that thing .<EOS>It's so big .<EOS>I've seen bigger . That's ...<EOS>Just a little prick .<EOS>It's a flu shot .<EOS>You've been in the coldness of space .<EOS>I do n't want you to get sick .<EOS>It's one thing to attack me .<EOS>It's quite another to attack my Mini-Me .<EOS>I'm gonna get you , Austin Powers .<EOS>I'm gonna get you .<EOS>
Thank you . Welcome back . Today we're doing a follow-up ... to a segment we did several months ago ... on ' Fathers who are trying to take over the world . '<EOS>Let's begin with Scott Evil .<EOS>
What's going on with your dad ?<EOS>Well , my dad tried to take over the world ... with a giant laser on the moon .<EOS>I know .<EOS>We have a surprise for you .<EOS>What , my dad ?<EOS>No , it's not your father . It's your mother .<EOS>Come on out .<EOS>

Thank you .<EOS>You know , what have we learned here today ?<EOS>Perhaps it's that no one can take your mojo .<EOS>You can look around all you want ... but what you're really trying to find is on the inside .<EOS>Take care of yourself and each other .<EOS>
I think I'm gonna like it in the Nineties .<EOS>I never knew it could be this way !<EOS>Oh , baby , baby , baby .<EOS>
That's good .<EOS>

Past Austin ?<EOS>Technically , it's not cheating , baby .<EOS>Felicity , I can n't blame you .<EOS>The man is handsome , baby !<EOS>We're just plain handsome , man .<EOS>Am I wrong , but this makes me horny , baby .<EOS>Very randy !<EOS>Well , one things for sure<EOS>-<EOS>I've got my mojo back .<EOS>

Hello up there .<EOS>Is the movie over ?<EOS>I'm still down here ... and I'm still in quite a lot of pain .<EOS>Maybe someone in the lobby could call an ambulance .<EOS>Oh , the pain is really quite severe .<EOS>I've fashioned a makeshift splint .<EOS>Here goes nothing .<EOS>
