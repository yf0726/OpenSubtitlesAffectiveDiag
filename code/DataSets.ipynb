       "\"2012 Written by Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser Second Draft February 19th, 2008 OVER BLACK We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the Clarinet Concerto in A. FADE UP EXT. THE SOLAR SYSTEM Space, infinite and empty. But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move into frame and align. The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun. Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space. FADE TO BLACK 2009 FADE UP EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66, listens to the music. An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle. The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy. PROF. WEST Watch out! But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship. In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance. The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics - University of New Delhi'. 2. INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32. PROF. WEST How deep are we? SATNAM 8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir. As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting for this science lab. PROF. WEST Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions. SATNAM Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me... They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier. SATNAM There was a new solar storm, so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe. PROF. WEST How can that be? SATNAM We don't know, Professor, sir. Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch on the floor and hot steam rises. SATNAM The neutrinos suddenly act like... microwaves. Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale. CUT TO: 3. EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and the Capitol Building. ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL AIDES. He is the only African-American among them. One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief of Staff, working the crowd. POLITICAL AID 2 Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and the Congress. ADRIAN Shame he's such a pompous ass. ANHEUSER Somebody mention my name? Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling. ADRIAN Yes sir... No, sir. ANHEUSER Which one is it? ADRIAN We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir. ANHEUSER It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that. Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile. POLITICAL AID 2 President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space. Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers. ANHEUSER That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command. Adrian and Laura look to each other baffled. 76. ANHEUSER ... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action... CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica. Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of candles. Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all are praying. A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance we hear SCREAMING. INT. SISTINE CHAPEL/CEILING - DAWN A few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under Michelangelo's famous fresco. Most prominent above them is `The Creation of Adam'. The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies. A crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God touching the finger of Adam. Then the whole fresco breaks apart. EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic-- The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto the fleeing masses. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNT CORCOVADO/RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY The giant statue of `Christ the Redeemer' on Mount Corcovado. Behind it, we see Rio de Janeiro being obliterated by violent quakes. 77. The famous statue of Jesus Christ begins to topple over and crashes down the mountain. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS/TIBET - NIGHT Neng Pang, the young Tibetan monk drives his truck up a bumpy mountain pass. His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up. The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries that the truck may be breaking down. He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise the steering wheel continues to vibrate. Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking violently. NENG Hold on back there! Rocks fall all around them. CUT TO: INT. THE ANTONOV - NIGHT Jackson sits inside one of the luxury cars and tries the radio. Kate opens the passenger door and gets in. JACKSON Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither. KATE Anything? JACKSON Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal. KATE I can't think about what's going on down there. Jackson switches off the radio. KATE I wanted to thank you. For coming back for us. 78. JACKSON I couldn't have left you... Silence. They both look out through the front windshield at Lilly and Noah curled up together. KATE Do you think people change? JACKSON By `people' are we talking about me? KATE Do you think you've changed since we separated? JACKSON Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now... KATE You know, you always had tunnel vision. You could always just block things out and write. You blocked all of us out Jackson. He thinks about this and can't help asking. JACKSON Do you love him? Gordon... KATE I love him enough. Kate gets out of the car and shuts the door. He watches her go. CUT TO: INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY The computers buzz with the incoming data. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER ... Cho Ming reports the first tremors, however none higher than 5.0. Anheuser looks relieved. Then the big news hits. SCIENCE OFFICER 1 1.2 percent, but still moving. ANHEUSER Any clue what to expect next, Professor? PROF. WEST Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt, we expect the formation of tidal waves, sir... proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes. Adrian looks distressed as he turns to one of the officers. ADRIAN Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard? Laura notices Adrian's concern. SCIENCE OFFICER 1 All global ground communication has ceased sir. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #2 The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming. ANHEUSER At least some good news. Anheuser turns to Adrian. ANHEUSER Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment? ADRIAN We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours. He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of commands. ADRIAN ... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation. 82. Everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to planet Earth. ADRIAN Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... ... These are their new positions. Anheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian. ANHEUSER So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin? Silence. Adrian clears his throat. ADRIAN It's the south pole, sir. An ALARM SIGNAL goes off-- CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN A red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel. YURI What's that? SASHA Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready. Yuri and Jackson are standing behind the pilots. JACKSON Let's go wake up the kids. Yuri nods and they make their way back to the lower deck. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her mom's lap. She looks like a little angel. Jackson can't bear to wake them. He caresses Lilly's face. NOAH Why do you hate Gordon? Jackson turns to see Noah is awake. 83. JACKSON What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon. NOAH But you don't like him either. JACKSON I don't know him that well. NOAH But I know him. He's really nice. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really well. This breaks Jackson's heart. He pulls Noah tightly to his chest. JACKSON I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise. Kate opens her eyes. KATE Is it time? Jackson nods. KATE Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to land. On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help the twins get into their life vests. Noah is suspicious. NOAH What's wrong? Jackson looks at his kids. They both look scared. JACKSON Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet. The Antonov jerks to the side. Two more engines out. Alarm signals flash. EXT. ANTONOV - DAWN The remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as it dives into the clouds. 84. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson and his family huddle together. He puts his arms around Lilly and Noah. JACKSON Your daddy has to tell you something. In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit. He is about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice. JACKSON I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both... Jackson glances at Kate. JACKSON I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been. Jackson looks Kate directly in the eyes. JACKSON ... And I am so very sorry for that. Gordon watches as Kate pulls the kids and Jackson tight. For the first time, they seem a little like the family they once were. GORDON Jackson, Yuri... I think you guys should come back up here. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN First Jackson and then Yuri enter the cockpit. Sasha points out of the window. SASHA Don't ask me how that happened. Behind them Yuri and Jackson stare at the snow covered mountains of the Himalayas. SASHA There's no more ocean, and it looks like we're pretty close to where we wanted to go. GORDON It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles... 85. JACKSON No shit. It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958. Jackson brims with joy. JACKSON Way to go Charlie! A JOLT! SASHA We lost our last two engines. The plane drops rapidly, nearly scraping the tip of a mountain. Sasha and Gordon are doing all they can to keep the Antonov in the air. A vast glacier spreads out in front of them. SASHA I'll shoot for that glacier. Drain the brake fluids. It's going to get rocky... There, the blue levers! The plane plummets, loosing altitude fast. SASHA Listen up guys! This may sound a little crazy, but here's what you got to do... INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson and Yuri come running. Yuri yells at his boys. YURI Get up! Follow me! TAMARA Yuri bear, what are we doing? YURI We're taking the Bentley! INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN Sasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel. The glittering snow field comes flying towards them. 86. SASHA CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast! Sasha pulls the Antonov back up. SASHA Now! Open it! Gordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN The cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to the glacier's surface. Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens. Everyone screams in panic. YURI SHUT UP EVERY ONE! They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly. YURI Engine... start... The motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson. YURI Voice control... Sold me on it. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon. SASHA Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down! GORDON What about you?! SASHA I'll be fine! I have to land this thing! Gordon hesitates. SASHA What are you waiting for! 87. Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice everywhere. The Bentley roars. YURI Push it Curtis! JACKSON We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon. Noah turns and sees Gordon. NOAH Tamara! Open the door! Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation. TAMARA Where's Sasha? GORDON He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down. Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing. LILLY Daaadddy! The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers. The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions. The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart. Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the deep. The plane crashes and explodes. 88. EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow. The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking. JACKSON Everybody okay back there? KATE We're all fine. The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES. One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a surreal sight-- Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass. GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from these flying machines. One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the Bentley. Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a sharp tone. CHINESE COMMANDER Welcome to the People's Republic of China. Jackson nods to them. JACKSON Thank you... Say thank you, kids. The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello... CHINESE COMMANDER What color are your passes? Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats. CHINESE COMMANDER What color are your boarding passes? Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their guns at them. 89. YURI I have green card. Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green plastic cards. YURI For my boys and me. Tamara can't believe what she's hearing. TAMARA It's a joke... a mistake... Right Yuri? Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him. TAMARA You disgust me. You pig. Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all understand him. YURI You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul. With that Yuri turns to the others. YURI I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first. Come boys! The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara. The next moment, the helicopter takes off. GORDON What!... Did that just happen!? They're stranded. CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD IN CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of waiting helicopters. 90. Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise. CHINESE OFFICER Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same. Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval Officer greets them, and raises his voice. CAPTAIN MICHAELS I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you! Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door slides shut and it lifts off. INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away. CAPTAIN MICHAELS My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father... Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Your party is the last to arrive. ANHEUSER I've been told of damages? CAPTAIN MICHAELS We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted. Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance. CAPTAIN MICHAELS There it is! EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing-- Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories, built into the face of a mountain. 91. In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped metal support structures, which are the launching towers for the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an unparalleled feat of engineering. EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting. The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows. She looks around in awe. Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain. In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with military personnel, waving his tickets. YURI What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor. SOLDIER I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements. YURI I want your name! SOLDIER Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained. The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid. CUT TO: EXT. THE GLACIER/CHO MING - DAWN Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape. They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a scree field. It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly. JACKSON Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great. 92. Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind. She's still very upset. TAMARA I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it. GORDON Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments? TAMARA Cheap bastard. GORDON You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true? Tamara nods silently. TAMARA Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri. Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine. JACKSON You guys hear that? In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it. EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of dust just as Jackson reaches the road. JACKSON Hey! Help! Wait for us! But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson, pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road. JACKSON Shit! Shit! Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck, turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of the cabin. Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't believe his luck. 93. The others show up and they all run towards the truck. CUT TO: INT. INSIDE MOUNTAIN/CHO MING - DAWN Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe-- Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the ship, readying it for launch. Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his huge family. Laura points down at the workers. LAURA Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people? The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns. ANHEUSER Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest. Laura hates him in that moment. ANHEUSER Captain? Where is the Bridge? Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals we saw being airlifted over the mountains. CHINESE STEWARD Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way. Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward. CUT TO: EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from destroyed cities in the distance. 94. Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's family trails behind. Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from the cities below. People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a number on its speed dial. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings. ADRIAN Satnam? Where are you? SATNAM On the Nampan Plateau... Adrian's face goes pale. ADRIAN What?! SATNAM There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge! ADRIAN Satnam, what happened? SATNAM We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came! Adrian closes his eyes. EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley. SATNAM I have to go! A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards him. A tidal wave of gigantic height. Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance. 95. He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable to do anything. As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead. Adrian is left breathless. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian storms onto the bridge. Many officers and analysts are at work under Captain Michaels. ADRIAN Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India? SCIENCE OFFICER One moment, sir. Anheuser and Prof. West step over and join him. ANHEUSER Helmsley, what's going on here? ADRIAN Looks like our model was wrong. They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves coming in from the south. ADRIAN Satnam was talking about a wave from the East. A science officer selects a different quadrant on the satellite display. They all stare at the new tidal wave that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley. PROF. WEST Jesus! Anheuser is shocked. ANHEUSER What does this mean? 96. ADRIAN The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please? As the officer does this, Prof. West looks at Adrian with questioning eyes. ADRIAN Satnam didn't get picked up. Prof. West is horrified. SCIENCE OFFICER Ready sir. Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley. ADRIAN This one is at least 1500 meters high! ANHEUSER Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us? ADRIAN Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down? Every one on the bridge stares at a display. It reads-- 02hrs - 09min - 07sec The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display changes to-- 00hrs - 28min - 10sec... and counting. We see the shock on Anheuser's face. ANHEUSER Get me the other Heads of State. CUT TO: EXT. GATE/CHO MING SITE - EARLY MORNING Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up to the service entrance of the launch site. A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin, who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'. Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck. 97. LIN Who are they? Neng answers hesitantly. NENG We found them by the side of the road, my brother. LIN You must send them back. NENG I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La. You know I cannot do that. The others watch the interaction but do not understand. Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah. JACKSON Come with daddy. Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin with his kids. JACKSON At least take our children with you. Please. Lin answers in broken English. LIN Why should I do that? JACKSON For the same reason you sent for your parents. Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to Mrs. Pang. KATE I have no clue if you understand what I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you! Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin. MRS. PANG We are all children of this earth. LIN My plan will not work for so many, mother. 98. She looks up at her son, determined. MRS. PANG We will take them all. Bata? Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang. KATE Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much. Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done. CUT TO: INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains. Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other. Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything, having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature. But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4 is being repaired, all the others are still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding. Suddenly SIRENS goes off! The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of workers and security personnel. INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers. They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps up and yells to the others. YURI They're leaving without us! The soldier from earlier points his gun at him. SOLDIER What did I tell you! Caesar barks at the guy. 99. YURI Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too! The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the other passengers surge forward with him. In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of Cho Ming Valley. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes-- The gates to the mountain open! LIN We have to hurry! They launch! We run out of time! They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky terrain. INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING A screeching and thundering noise! THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless corridor. She struggles to fight her way through. A digital voice blares over the speakers. COMPUTER VOICE Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds. Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers. 100. LAURA Where can I find Adrian Helmsley? SCIENCE OFFICER He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies. EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal ladders of one of the launch towers. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the preparations from a large window. He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as they continue to be pulled into place. INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command posts. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the first to climb out. Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made behemoth. Lin hastily pulls the others up. LIN Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand. It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson hurries to pull up the rest of the group. Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship. 101. JACKSON Move Lil'bee! Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform. As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both see this, but Jackson is closer-- He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to his death. For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod. EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their final launching position. A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform. The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships. TAMARA Oh my god, that's Yuri! Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells! TAMARA Caesar! EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms, leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the platform with the launching towers. Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs them by their necks. YURI Let that stupid dog go! 102. He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the drop off at the edge of the platform. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch lines up directly in front of Lin and his group. LIN Okay. Now! One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back. JACKSON Tamara! Come on! Get in! She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog darting towards her. EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either side tumble off the platform. Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder leading down. YURI Down there! Oleg, you go first! As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running towards Tamara. OLEG Daddy look, Tamara! Yuri cannot believe his eyes. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel. TAMARA Caesar darling! Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch. 103. JACKSON Tamara! Get in! Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns. TAMARA Come to mommy! Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives Yuri the finger. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the hydraulics for the tail gate are located. He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power drill, almost too big to be carried by one person. Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson. LIN I need your help. INT. TECHNICAL COMMAND CENTER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Laura and the Science Officer enter the Technical Command Center. She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms. People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their desperation to board the ship. LAURA What in god's name is happening Adrian? ADRIAN Anheuser convinced them all to launch. Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life! Deserted passengers waving their green cards! Adrian makes a decision and rushes out. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser turns hearing Adrian storming onto the bridge. ADRIAN Anheuser! We have to stop this madness. 104. With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer. ADRIAN Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this. The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background. ANHEUSER What do you think you're doing? ADRIAN I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on! Bobby flicks a switch. Adrian's voice echoes through all the ships. ADRIAN This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson... INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the bridge of the European Ship. GERMAN CHANCELLOR Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann? Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers. ADRIAN I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization... INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser looks on stoney faced. ADRIAN ... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die? Laura watches him proudly. 105. ADRIAN A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. Or at least I don't want to be part of it. Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm. ANHEUSER We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off. The Communications Officer looks at Adrian. ANHEUSER That's an order soldier. ADRIAN Don't do it! INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY The Russian President, together with the heads of state from China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds. ADRIAN We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser has had enough. ANHEUSER Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow. He's almost screaming now. ANHEUSER Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?! Silence. Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and instead speaks softly now. 106. ADRIAN There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives. All eyes are glued to Adrian. ADRIAN I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why? Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues. ADRIAN He died because we forgot to pick him up. I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children? Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian. LAURA If my father were here, he would open the gates. Adrian and Laura share a look. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT The people of Russia along with... INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY His Asian colleagues nod in approval. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ... China and Japan agree to open the gates. INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY The German Chancellor speaks up. GERMAN CHANCELLOR The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister... 107. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY GERMAN CHANCELLOR ... We vote to open the gates. Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat. Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian turns to the Captain. ADRIAN Captain Michaels, you heard them. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships begin to creek open. The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly! INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with Kate in a large bay on the other side. LILLY Phew... It stinks in here. Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in DISBELIEF-- A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks at her. TAMARA Sssh...Caesar. A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They are in the zoological bay. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the connecting tunnel. Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams. LIN They're opening the gate! It will crush us! The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it. 108. JACKSON Noah! Watch out! Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength, he shoves the boy into the tunnel. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him off the ladder. KATE No! INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the sloping surface, but he can't. He slips. Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look with Jackson before he dies. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel. NOAH Something happened, mom. Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights back the tears. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their remaining space is shrinking every second. JACKSON We have to stop it! Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall. As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to slow down. 109. EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING - DAY Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped. Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be crushed. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill. Suddenly he slips. Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it. He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a halt. JACKSON You did it, man. You did it. In great pain, Lin grins back at him. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a thundering noise. People begin to rush on board. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his officers. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What's wrong with the gate? OFFICER I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir. The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and Adrian share a worried look. We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring! CUT TO: EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY Lama Yak La rings the large bronze bell of his monastery. 110. The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up-- A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains. The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is wiped clean from the earth. CUT TO: INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The technicians desperately try to figure out what's wrong. An officer waves Adrian over. SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay. ADRIAN Can you zoom in? The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura. ADRIAN I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it. Captain Michaels shouts across the room. CAPTAIN MICHAELS We're loaded. We can close the gates sir. ANHEUSER Do it! Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34 EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the American ship. Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up. YURI Pull yourself up! Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate. 111. Inside the ship, officers yell. DECK OFFICER To the lower decks people! The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close. Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot quite reach. Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding. YURI Oleg! Catch your brother! Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms. Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath. Oleg pulls his brother from above. INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate. DECK OFFICER Boys, you gotta move. ALEC We wait for our father! He's still down there! The loading officer attempts to comfort them. DECK OFFICER There's no one down there. Come on boys, come... The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt. The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors. ANHEUSER Why is the stern gate not closing? 112. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir. ADRIAN Captain, over here. They race over. Adrian points to a monitor. ADRIAN I think we found the problem. On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately waiting for Jackson and Lin. ADRIAN How did they get in there? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There... Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling along a wounded Lin. LAURA That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong. ANHEUSER You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean... Adrian tries to ignore this. ADRIAN Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber. Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura. ANHEUSER You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter? Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in the face. He drops to the floor, out cold. Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian looks around. 113. ADRIAN What are you all waiting for? They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec. CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD/TIBET - DAY Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming force. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However, the props of the American ship don't move. In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the officers explains. TECHNICAL OFFICER If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start. ADRIAN There's no way to override it? TECHNICAL OFFICER No sir, it has to be done manually. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate, Noah and Lilly watch as Jackson nears the end of the tunnel with Lin. Neng comforts his brother who's about to pass out. NENG Almost there, Lin... CUT TO: 114. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY THE WAVE FINALLY HITS! All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water. They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers they're resting on, keep them anchored. INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open stern gate of the American ship. The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec and Oleg. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura, Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor, as the vessel undulates back and forth. SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Water has penetrated the stern! Laura looks unsure. LAURA What now? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time. Adrian looks at him. ADRIAN Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER If we don't hurry, we won't be able to. Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry. Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin. 115. Kate shouts across to Tamara. KATE Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah. Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother. Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost tearful with relief to see him. KATE I was so worried about you. Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off. Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family. LILLY Mummy! Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level continues to rise. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor, in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew approaching. But between them she spots the next chamber door rising quickly. TAMARA Lilly run! Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar. Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she looks down and is too scared to jump. TAMARA Lilly! Take him. Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar above the quickly narrowing gap. In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground. 116. Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Laura picks Lilly up and comforts her. Adrian realizes they are too late. He turns to the rescue crew. ADRIAN Is there any way to talk to them? Lilly is close to tears. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with his unconscious brother. JACKSON We have to move him higher. Over there! Suddenly, a VIOLENT SHAKE throws them all off balance, pitching them into the water. EXT. LAUNCH PILLAR/UNDER WATER - DAY In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's launch towers. Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other launch towers follow like dominos. The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting sideways, rudderless. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Chaos. Fear. Everybody holds on for dear life. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Alec and Oleg scream, desperately trying to hold on as the whole ship capsizes. 117. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed around by the debris and raging waters. But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up and seems to steady itself. However, the strong currents continue to force it through the mountain ranges of the Himalayas. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The officers try to regain some control. NAVAL OFFICER Moving at 34 knots, sir. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What is our position? NAVIGATION OFFICER Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir. The Captain's face drops. CAPTAIN MICHAELS You must be kidding! INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound for the first time. KATE We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die. A split second later Noah holds out his belt. NOAH Mum, will this do? Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker. ADRIAN Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me. Kate screams with relief. 118. KATE Lilly! INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next to him, holding Lilly. LILLY I'm alright Mom! Caesar barks. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and smiles with relief. She is struggling to stay afloat though, and is running out of air. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson discovers the wall speaker. He moves closer to it. ADRIAN We can't get to you. Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get it out... None of us will make it. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY All eyes are on Adrian as he speaks. ADRIAN You're our only hope. Adrian looks at Laura. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY JACKSON I'll go back. I'll try my best. NOAH I'll go with you. JACKSON You stay with Mommy. Jackson looks at Kate. 119. JACKSON I'll be right back... The water is up to their chest now. Jackson takes a breath and disappears underwater. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him. ANHEUSER Captain, what's happening? The Captain looks at him annoyed. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What's happening?... We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser. Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the distance. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the jammed power tool, pulling at it. But it doesn't budge. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now and she goes under. She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around desperately for a way out but there is none. Tamara drowns. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs with air and thinks hard. As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He dives under again. 120. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents. Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls it tight. Lin screams. Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed, to go and help his father. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet. Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face of Mount Everest is almost upon them. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin. After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified to see that Noah is nowhere to be found. KATE Noah! INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift the drill. To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping. Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to loosen it before finally the drill comes free. Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop. He dives back down for it. 121. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Noah emerges from the water. NOAH Mom, we did it! Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe. Noah smiles and calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Lilly and Laura wait nervously. They hear a muffled voice. NOAH We got it free. Can you hear me? We did it! Adrian leaps up when he hears this. He flicks a button on the intercom. ADRIAN Captain Michaels - close the gate! INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Hearing this, the Captain yells the eagerly awaited order. CAPTAIN MICHAELS That's affirmative. Close the gate! TECHNICAL OFFICER Ay, ay, Sir. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYAS - DAY We hear a BOOMING sound as the tail gate finally seals. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that instead. He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as he turns to swim back, his face freezes-- He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats inches from his face. 122. EXT. PROPELLERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The gigantic propellers fight against the current, hitting rock at the base of the mountain. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The battle seems hopeless. Captain Michaels yells at the top of his lungs. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Engage starboard stabilizers! OFFICERS One is engaged... two is engaged... number three is out, sir! The vessel scrapes against the rocks, throwing Anheuser to the floor. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY The giant ship escapes the mountain with an inch to spare. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest, earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past. After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate hears the CHEERING coming from the speakers. The water level stops rising but she still looks around in panic. KATE Noah! Where is he? Noah begins to cry. NOAH He was just behind me... Finally! Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull of wonderful air. Kate and Noah are overjoyed. The Pangs smile to one another. Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes. 123. JACKSON If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me. Kate embraces him tightly. KATE Whatever you do... I will never let you go again. Noah is all smiles. FADE TO BLACK 2013 We hear a voice. ADRIAN ... Day 988. No one is waiting for anything to happen... FADE UP The CAMERA moves over the last lines of Jackson's novel. INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian sits in his cabin, his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' in his lap. ADRIAN ... and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas. Opposite him, Laura sits listening to him read. ADRIAN ... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. The end. Adrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence. LAURA How many copies did you say that sold? 124. ADRIAN Less than 500. It's what you might call a cult classic. Laura looks at him grinning. LAURA It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley? ADRIAN Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements. LAURA Actually my diary's pretty open. The intimate moment is cut short. OFFICER Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian and Laura make their way to the bridge. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I will be giving the orders to unseal the decks. INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other people who are gathering in anticipation. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Please be careful when you step out and of course... enjoy the fresh air. Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket. She is holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar. LILLY Daddy? When can we go back home? 125. JACKSON There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared. LILLY I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups. JACKSON That's my big girl. Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder. OLEG Can we pet him? Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her. LILLY Of course you can. He's your doggie. The boys both smile at her. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian and Laura enter the bridge. ADRIAN You called for me, sir? CAPTAIN MICHAELS Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley. The Captain directs him to a monitor. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Looks like your scientific projections are way off again. The Captain grins at Prof. West. PROF. WEST The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian... A monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip is enlarged. LAURA What's that? 126. PROF. WEST It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Our European colleagues have already set course for it. Captain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Here, somebody wants to talk to you. Adrian curious, grabs the mic. ADRIAN This is Helmsley. We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY Harry Helmsley stands beside the cruise ship's Captain. VOICE No, this is Helmsley. ADRIAN Dad!... Is that you? INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian is ecstatic. Captain Michaels explains. CAPTAIN MICHAELS We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly. ADRIAN Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony? INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY Harry looks over at Tony who's listening, smiling. HARRY HELMSLEY He's fine, son. We're all fine. 127. ADRIAN See you guys soon. Bye dad. Harry hangs up. He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura and kisses her on the lips. She squeals. ANHEUSER Put that woman down Helmsley. Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say. ANHEUSER Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world... Adrian and Laura exchange a look. ANHEUSER I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours. Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave. ANHEUSER Mr. Helmsley, one more thing. Adrian turns back. ANHEUSER There was no one. ADRIAN Pardon me? ANHEUSER There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that. Anheuser puts out his hand. Adrian takes it. INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY CAPTAIN MICHAELS This is your Captain speaking. Standby to open Deck 1. OFFICER Standing by Sir. 128. Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband. MRS. PANG I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars? MR.PANG Do not fear. Some things will never change. The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah. JACKSON I thought you might want this. He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to him. NOAH Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad? Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them. ADRIAN I finally finished your book Jackson. KATE Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end. Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully. JACKSON Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think? Adrian smiles. ADRIAN I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole. Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd. Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to roll back and light streams in. 129. The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first rays of daylight hit their faces. EXT. AMERICAN SHIP/SOMEWHERE IN THE HIMALAYAS - DAY Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of day. A majestic moment. EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice- covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy. Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site-- The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak, surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most beautiful rainbow. This is the new world. And again we hear Mozart's Adagio... THE END\""

       "\"2012 Written by Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser Second Draft February 19th, 2008 OVER BLACK We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the Clarinet Concerto in A. FADE UP EXT. THE SOLAR SYSTEM Space, infinite and empty. But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move into frame and align. The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun. Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space. FADE TO BLACK 2009 FADE UP EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66, listens to the music. An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle. The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy. PROF. WEST Watch out! But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship. In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance. The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics - University of New Delhi'. 2. INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32. PROF. WEST How deep are we? SATNAM 8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir. As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting for this science lab. PROF. WEST Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions. SATNAM Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me... They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier. SATNAM There was a new solar storm, so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe. PROF. WEST How can that be? SATNAM We don't know, Professor, sir. Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch on the floor and hot steam rises. SATNAM The neutrinos suddenly act like... microwaves. Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale. CUT TO: 3. EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and the Capitol Building. ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL AIDES. He is the only African-American among them. One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief of Staff, working the crowd. POLITICAL AID 2 Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and the Congress. ADRIAN Shame he's such a pompous ass. ANHEUSER Somebody mention my name? Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling. ADRIAN Yes sir... No, sir. ANHEUSER Which one is it? ADRIAN We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir. ANHEUSER It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that. Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile. POLITICAL AID 2 President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space. Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers. ANHEUSER That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command. Adrian and Laura look to each other baffled. 76. ANHEUSER ... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action... CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica. Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of candles. Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all are praying. A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance we hear SCREAMING. INT. SISTINE CHAPEL/CEILING - DAWN A few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under Michelangelo's famous fresco. Most prominent above them is `The Creation of Adam'. The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies. A crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God touching the finger of Adam. Then the whole fresco breaks apart. EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic-- The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto the fleeing masses. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNT CORCOVADO/RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY The giant statue of `Christ the Redeemer' on Mount Corcovado. Behind it, we see Rio de Janeiro being obliterated by violent quakes. 77. The famous statue of Jesus Christ begins to topple over and crashes down the mountain. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS/TIBET - NIGHT Neng Pang, the young Tibetan monk drives his truck up a bumpy mountain pass. His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up. The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries that the truck may be breaking down. He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise the steering wheel continues to vibrate. Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking violently. NENG Hold on back there! Rocks fall all around them. CUT TO: INT. THE ANTONOV - NIGHT Jackson sits inside one of the luxury cars and tries the radio. Kate opens the passenger door and gets in. JACKSON Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither. KATE Anything? JACKSON Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal. KATE I can't think about what's going on down there. Jackson switches off the radio. KATE I wanted to thank you. For coming back for us. 78. JACKSON I couldn't have left you... Silence. They both look out through the front windshield at Lilly and Noah curled up together. KATE Do you think people change? JACKSON By `people' are we talking about me? KATE Do you think you've changed since we separated? JACKSON Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now... KATE You know, you always had tunnel vision. You could always just block things out and write. You blocked all of us out Jackson. He thinks about this and can't help asking. JACKSON Do you love him? Gordon... KATE I love him enough. Kate gets out of the car and shuts the door. He watches her go. CUT TO: INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY The computers buzz with the incoming data. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER ... Cho Ming reports the first tremors, however none higher than 5.0. Anheuser looks relieved. Then the big news hits. SCIENCE OFFICER 1 1.2 percent, but still moving. ANHEUSER Any clue what to expect next, Professor? PROF. WEST Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt, we expect the formation of tidal waves, sir... proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes. Adrian looks distressed as he turns to one of the officers. ADRIAN Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard? Laura notices Adrian's concern. SCIENCE OFFICER 1 All global ground communication has ceased sir. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #2 The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming. ANHEUSER At least some good news. Anheuser turns to Adrian. ANHEUSER Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment? ADRIAN We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours. He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of commands. ADRIAN ... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation. 82. Everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to planet Earth. ADRIAN Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... ... These are their new positions. Anheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian. ANHEUSER So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin? Silence. Adrian clears his throat. ADRIAN It's the south pole, sir. An ALARM SIGNAL goes off-- CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN A red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel. YURI What's that? SASHA Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready. Yuri and Jackson are standing behind the pilots. JACKSON Let's go wake up the kids. Yuri nods and they make their way back to the lower deck. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her mom's lap. She looks like a little angel. Jackson can't bear to wake them. He caresses Lilly's face. NOAH Why do you hate Gordon? Jackson turns to see Noah is awake. 83. JACKSON What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon. NOAH But you don't like him either. JACKSON I don't know him that well. NOAH But I know him. He's really nice. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really well. This breaks Jackson's heart. He pulls Noah tightly to his chest. JACKSON I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise. Kate opens her eyes. KATE Is it time? Jackson nods. KATE Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to land. On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help the twins get into their life vests. Noah is suspicious. NOAH What's wrong? Jackson looks at his kids. They both look scared. JACKSON Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet. The Antonov jerks to the side. Two more engines out. Alarm signals flash. EXT. ANTONOV - DAWN The remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as it dives into the clouds. 84. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson and his family huddle together. He puts his arms around Lilly and Noah. JACKSON Your daddy has to tell you something. In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit. He is about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice. JACKSON I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both... Jackson glances at Kate. JACKSON I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been. Jackson looks Kate directly in the eyes. JACKSON ... And I am so very sorry for that. Gordon watches as Kate pulls the kids and Jackson tight. For the first time, they seem a little like the family they once were. GORDON Jackson, Yuri... I think you guys should come back up here. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN First Jackson and then Yuri enter the cockpit. Sasha points out of the window. SASHA Don't ask me how that happened. Behind them Yuri and Jackson stare at the snow covered mountains of the Himalayas. SASHA There's no more ocean, and it looks like we're pretty close to where we wanted to go. GORDON It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles... 85. JACKSON No shit. It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958. Jackson brims with joy. JACKSON Way to go Charlie! A JOLT! SASHA We lost our last two engines. The plane drops rapidly, nearly scraping the tip of a mountain. Sasha and Gordon are doing all they can to keep the Antonov in the air. A vast glacier spreads out in front of them. SASHA I'll shoot for that glacier. Drain the brake fluids. It's going to get rocky... There, the blue levers! The plane plummets, loosing altitude fast. SASHA Listen up guys! This may sound a little crazy, but here's what you got to do... INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson and Yuri come running. Yuri yells at his boys. YURI Get up! Follow me! TAMARA Yuri bear, what are we doing? YURI We're taking the Bentley! INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN Sasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel. The glittering snow field comes flying towards them. 86. SASHA CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast! Sasha pulls the Antonov back up. SASHA Now! Open it! Gordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN The cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to the glacier's surface. Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens. Everyone screams in panic. YURI SHUT UP EVERY ONE! They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly. YURI Engine... start... The motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson. YURI Voice control... Sold me on it. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon. SASHA Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down! GORDON What about you?! SASHA I'll be fine! I have to land this thing! Gordon hesitates. SASHA What are you waiting for! 87. Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice everywhere. The Bentley roars. YURI Push it Curtis! JACKSON We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon. Noah turns and sees Gordon. NOAH Tamara! Open the door! Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation. TAMARA Where's Sasha? GORDON He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down. Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing. LILLY Daaadddy! The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers. The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions. The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart. Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the deep. The plane crashes and explodes. 88. EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow. The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking. JACKSON Everybody okay back there? KATE We're all fine. The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES. One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a surreal sight-- Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass. GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from these flying machines. One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the Bentley. Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a sharp tone. CHINESE COMMANDER Welcome to the People's Republic of China. Jackson nods to them. JACKSON Thank you... Say thank you, kids. The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello... CHINESE COMMANDER What color are your passes? Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats. CHINESE COMMANDER What color are your boarding passes? Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their guns at them. 89. YURI I have green card. Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green plastic cards. YURI For my boys and me. Tamara can't believe what she's hearing. TAMARA It's a joke... a mistake... Right Yuri? Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him. TAMARA You disgust me. You pig. Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all understand him. YURI You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul. With that Yuri turns to the others. YURI I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first. Come boys! The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara. The next moment, the helicopter takes off. GORDON What!... Did that just happen!? They're stranded. CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD IN CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of waiting helicopters. 90. Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise. CHINESE OFFICER Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same. Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval Officer greets them, and raises his voice. CAPTAIN MICHAELS I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you! Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door slides shut and it lifts off. INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away. CAPTAIN MICHAELS My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father... Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Your party is the last to arrive. ANHEUSER I've been told of damages? CAPTAIN MICHAELS We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted. Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance. CAPTAIN MICHAELS There it is! EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing-- Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories, built into the face of a mountain. 91. In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped metal support structures, which are the launching towers for the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an unparalleled feat of engineering. EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting. The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows. She looks around in awe. Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain. In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with military personnel, waving his tickets. YURI What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor. SOLDIER I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements. YURI I want your name! SOLDIER Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained. The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid. CUT TO: EXT. THE GLACIER/CHO MING - DAWN Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape. They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a scree field. It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly. JACKSON Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great. 92. Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind. She's still very upset. TAMARA I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it. GORDON Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments? TAMARA Cheap bastard. GORDON You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true? Tamara nods silently. TAMARA Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri. Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine. JACKSON You guys hear that? In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it. EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of dust just as Jackson reaches the road. JACKSON Hey! Help! Wait for us! But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson, pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road. JACKSON Shit! Shit! Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck, turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of the cabin. Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't believe his luck. 93. The others show up and they all run towards the truck. CUT TO: INT. INSIDE MOUNTAIN/CHO MING - DAWN Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe-- Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the ship, readying it for launch. Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his huge family. Laura points down at the workers. LAURA Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people? The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns. ANHEUSER Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest. Laura hates him in that moment. ANHEUSER Captain? Where is the Bridge? Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals we saw being airlifted over the mountains. CHINESE STEWARD Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way. Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward. CUT TO: EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from destroyed cities in the distance. 94. Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's family trails behind. Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from the cities below. People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a number on its speed dial. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings. ADRIAN Satnam? Where are you? SATNAM On the Nampan Plateau... Adrian's face goes pale. ADRIAN What?! SATNAM There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge! ADRIAN Satnam, what happened? SATNAM We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came! Adrian closes his eyes. EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley. SATNAM I have to go! A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards him. A tidal wave of gigantic height. Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance. 95. He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable to do anything. As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead. Adrian is left breathless. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian storms onto the bridge. Many officers and analysts are at work under Captain Michaels. ADRIAN Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India? SCIENCE OFFICER One moment, sir. Anheuser and Prof. West step over and join him. ANHEUSER Helmsley, what's going on here? ADRIAN Looks like our model was wrong. They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves coming in from the south. ADRIAN Satnam was talking about a wave from the East. A science officer selects a different quadrant on the satellite display. They all stare at the new tidal wave that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley. PROF. WEST Jesus! Anheuser is shocked. ANHEUSER What does this mean? 96. ADRIAN The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please? As the officer does this, Prof. West looks at Adrian with questioning eyes. ADRIAN Satnam didn't get picked up. Prof. West is horrified. SCIENCE OFFICER Ready sir. Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley. ADRIAN This one is at least 1500 meters high! ANHEUSER Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us? ADRIAN Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down? Every one on the bridge stares at a display. It reads-- 02hrs - 09min - 07sec The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display changes to-- 00hrs - 28min - 10sec... and counting. We see the shock on Anheuser's face. ANHEUSER Get me the other Heads of State. CUT TO: EXT. GATE/CHO MING SITE - EARLY MORNING Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up to the service entrance of the launch site. A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin, who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'. Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck. 97. LIN Who are they? Neng answers hesitantly. NENG We found them by the side of the road, my brother. LIN You must send them back. NENG I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La. You know I cannot do that. The others watch the interaction but do not understand. Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah. JACKSON Come with daddy. Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin with his kids. JACKSON At least take our children with you. Please. Lin answers in broken English. LIN Why should I do that? JACKSON For the same reason you sent for your parents. Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to Mrs. Pang. KATE I have no clue if you understand what I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you! Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin. MRS. PANG We are all children of this earth. LIN My plan will not work for so many, mother. 98. She looks up at her son, determined. MRS. PANG We will take them all. Bata? Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang. KATE Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much. Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done. CUT TO: INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains. Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other. Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything, having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature. But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4 is being repaired, all the others are still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding. Suddenly SIRENS goes off! The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of workers and security personnel. INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers. They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps up and yells to the others. YURI They're leaving without us! The soldier from earlier points his gun at him. SOLDIER What did I tell you! Caesar barks at the guy. 99. YURI Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too! The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the other passengers surge forward with him. In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of Cho Ming Valley. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes-- The gates to the mountain open! LIN We have to hurry! They launch! We run out of time! They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky terrain. INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING A screeching and thundering noise! THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless corridor. She struggles to fight her way through. A digital voice blares over the speakers. COMPUTER VOICE Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds. Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers. 100. LAURA Where can I find Adrian Helmsley? SCIENCE OFFICER He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies. EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal ladders of one of the launch towers. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the preparations from a large window. He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as they continue to be pulled into place. INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command posts. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the first to climb out. Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made behemoth. Lin hastily pulls the others up. LIN Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand. It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson hurries to pull up the rest of the group. Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship. 101. JACKSON Move Lil'bee! Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform. As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both see this, but Jackson is closer-- He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to his death. For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod. EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their final launching position. A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform. The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships. TAMARA Oh my god, that's Yuri! Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells! TAMARA Caesar! EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms, leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the platform with the launching towers. Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs them by their necks. YURI Let that stupid dog go! 102. He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the drop off at the edge of the platform. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch lines up directly in front of Lin and his group. LIN Okay. Now! One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back. JACKSON Tamara! Come on! Get in! She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog darting towards her. EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either side tumble off the platform. Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder leading down. YURI Down there! Oleg, you go first! As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running towards Tamara. OLEG Daddy look, Tamara! Yuri cannot believe his eyes. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel. TAMARA Caesar darling! Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch. 103. JACKSON Tamara! Get in! Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns. TAMARA Come to mommy! Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives Yuri the finger. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the hydraulics for the tail gate are located. He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power drill, almost too big to be carried by one person. Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson. LIN I need your help. INT. TECHNICAL COMMAND CENTER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Laura and the Science Officer enter the Technical Command Center. She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms. People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their desperation to board the ship. LAURA What in god's name is happening Adrian? ADRIAN Anheuser convinced them all to launch. Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life! Deserted passengers waving their green cards! Adrian makes a decision and rushes out. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser turns hearing Adrian storming onto the bridge. ADRIAN Anheuser! We have to stop this madness. 104. With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer. ADRIAN Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this. The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background. ANHEUSER What do you think you're doing? ADRIAN I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on! Bobby flicks a switch. Adrian's voice echoes through all the ships. ADRIAN This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson... INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the bridge of the European Ship. GERMAN CHANCELLOR Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann? Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers. ADRIAN I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization... INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser looks on stoney faced. ADRIAN ... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die? Laura watches him proudly. 105. ADRIAN A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. Or at least I don't want to be part of it. Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm. ANHEUSER We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off. The Communications Officer looks at Adrian. ANHEUSER That's an order soldier. ADRIAN Don't do it! INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY The Russian President, together with the heads of state from China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds. ADRIAN We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser has had enough. ANHEUSER Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow. He's almost screaming now. ANHEUSER Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?! Silence. Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and instead speaks softly now. 106. ADRIAN There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives. All eyes are glued to Adrian. ADRIAN I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why? Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues. ADRIAN He died because we forgot to pick him up. I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children? Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian. LAURA If my father were here, he would open the gates. Adrian and Laura share a look. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT The people of Russia along with... INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY His Asian colleagues nod in approval. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ... China and Japan agree to open the gates. INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY The German Chancellor speaks up. GERMAN CHANCELLOR The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister... 107. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY GERMAN CHANCELLOR ... We vote to open the gates. Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat. Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian turns to the Captain. ADRIAN Captain Michaels, you heard them. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships begin to creek open. The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly! INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with Kate in a large bay on the other side. LILLY Phew... It stinks in here. Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in DISBELIEF-- A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks at her. TAMARA Sssh...Caesar. A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They are in the zoological bay. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the connecting tunnel. Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams. LIN They're opening the gate! It will crush us! The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it. 108. JACKSON Noah! Watch out! Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength, he shoves the boy into the tunnel. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him off the ladder. KATE No! INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the sloping surface, but he can't. He slips. Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look with Jackson before he dies. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel. NOAH Something happened, mom. Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights back the tears. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their remaining space is shrinking every second. JACKSON We have to stop it! Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall. As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to slow down. 109. EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING - DAY Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped. Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be crushed. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill. Suddenly he slips. Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it. He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a halt. JACKSON You did it, man. You did it. In great pain, Lin grins back at him. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a thundering noise. People begin to rush on board. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his officers. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What's wrong with the gate? OFFICER I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir. The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and Adrian share a worried look. We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring! CUT TO: EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY Lama Yak La rings the large bronze bell of his monastery. 110. The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up-- A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains. The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is wiped clean from the earth. CUT TO: INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The technicians desperately try to figure out what's wrong. An officer waves Adrian over. SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay. ADRIAN Can you zoom in? The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura. ADRIAN I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it. Captain Michaels shouts across the room. CAPTAIN MICHAELS We're loaded. We can close the gates sir. ANHEUSER Do it! Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34 EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the American ship. Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up. YURI Pull yourself up! Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate. 111. Inside the ship, officers yell. DECK OFFICER To the lower decks people! The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close. Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot quite reach. Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding. YURI Oleg! Catch your brother! Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms. Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath. Oleg pulls his brother from above. INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate. DECK OFFICER Boys, you gotta move. ALEC We wait for our father! He's still down there! The loading officer attempts to comfort them. DECK OFFICER There's no one down there. Come on boys, come... The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt. The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors. ANHEUSER Why is the stern gate not closing? 112. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir. ADRIAN Captain, over here. They race over. Adrian points to a monitor. ADRIAN I think we found the problem. On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately waiting for Jackson and Lin. ADRIAN How did they get in there? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There... Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling along a wounded Lin. LAURA That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong. ANHEUSER You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean... Adrian tries to ignore this. ADRIAN Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber. Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura. ANHEUSER You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter? Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in the face. He drops to the floor, out cold. Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian looks around. 113. ADRIAN What are you all waiting for? They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec. CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD/TIBET - DAY Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming force. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However, the props of the American ship don't move. In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the officers explains. TECHNICAL OFFICER If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start. ADRIAN There's no way to override it? TECHNICAL OFFICER No sir, it has to be done manually. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate, Noah and Lilly watch as Jackson nears the end of the tunnel with Lin. Neng comforts his brother who's about to pass out. NENG Almost there, Lin... CUT TO: 114. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY THE WAVE FINALLY HITS! All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water. They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers they're resting on, keep them anchored. INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open stern gate of the American ship. The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec and Oleg. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura, Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor, as the vessel undulates back and forth. SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Water has penetrated the stern! Laura looks unsure. LAURA What now? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time. Adrian looks at him. ADRIAN Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER If we don't hurry, we won't be able to. Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry. Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin. 115. Kate shouts across to Tamara. KATE Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah. Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother. Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost tearful with relief to see him. KATE I was so worried about you. Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off. Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family. LILLY Mummy! Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level continues to rise. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor, in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew approaching. But between them she spots the next chamber door rising quickly. TAMARA Lilly run! Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar. Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she looks down and is too scared to jump. TAMARA Lilly! Take him. Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar above the quickly narrowing gap. In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground. 116. Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Laura picks Lilly up and comforts her. Adrian realizes they are too late. He turns to the rescue crew. ADRIAN Is there any way to talk to them? Lilly is close to tears. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with his unconscious brother. JACKSON We have to move him higher. Over there! Suddenly, a VIOLENT SHAKE throws them all off balance, pitching them into the water. EXT. LAUNCH PILLAR/UNDER WATER - DAY In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's launch towers. Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other launch towers follow like dominos. The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting sideways, rudderless. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Chaos. Fear. Everybody holds on for dear life. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Alec and Oleg scream, desperately trying to hold on as the whole ship capsizes. 117. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed around by the debris and raging waters. But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up and seems to steady itself. However, the strong currents continue to force it through the mountain ranges of the Himalayas. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The officers try to regain some control. NAVAL OFFICER Moving at 34 knots, sir. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What is our position? NAVIGATION OFFICER Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir. The Captain's face drops. CAPTAIN MICHAELS You must be kidding! INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound for the first time. KATE We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die. A split second later Noah holds out his belt. NOAH Mum, will this do? Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker. ADRIAN Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me. Kate screams with relief. 118. KATE Lilly! INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next to him, holding Lilly. LILLY I'm alright Mom! Caesar barks. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and smiles with relief. She is struggling to stay afloat though, and is running out of air. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson discovers the wall speaker. He moves closer to it. ADRIAN We can't get to you. Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get it out... None of us will make it. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY All eyes are on Adrian as he speaks. ADRIAN You're our only hope. Adrian looks at Laura. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY JACKSON I'll go back. I'll try my best. NOAH I'll go with you. JACKSON You stay with Mommy. Jackson looks at Kate. 119. JACKSON I'll be right back... The water is up to their chest now. Jackson takes a breath and disappears underwater. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him. ANHEUSER Captain, what's happening? The Captain looks at him annoyed. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What's happening?... We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser. Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the distance. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the jammed power tool, pulling at it. But it doesn't budge. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now and she goes under. She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around desperately for a way out but there is none. Tamara drowns. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs with air and thinks hard. As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He dives under again. 120. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents. Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls it tight. Lin screams. Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed, to go and help his father. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet. Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face of Mount Everest is almost upon them. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin. After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified to see that Noah is nowhere to be found. KATE Noah! INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift the drill. To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping. Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to loosen it before finally the drill comes free. Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop. He dives back down for it. 121. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Noah emerges from the water. NOAH Mom, we did it! Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe. Noah smiles and calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Lilly and Laura wait nervously. They hear a muffled voice. NOAH We got it free. Can you hear me? We did it! Adrian leaps up when he hears this. He flicks a button on the intercom. ADRIAN Captain Michaels - close the gate! INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Hearing this, the Captain yells the eagerly awaited order. CAPTAIN MICHAELS That's affirmative. Close the gate! TECHNICAL OFFICER Ay, ay, Sir. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYAS - DAY We hear a BOOMING sound as the tail gate finally seals. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that instead. He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as he turns to swim back, his face freezes-- He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats inches from his face. 122. EXT. PROPELLERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The gigantic propellers fight against the current, hitting rock at the base of the mountain. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The battle seems hopeless. Captain Michaels yells at the top of his lungs. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Engage starboard stabilizers! OFFICERS One is engaged... two is engaged... number three is out, sir! The vessel scrapes against the rocks, throwing Anheuser to the floor. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY The giant ship escapes the mountain with an inch to spare. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest, earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past. After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate hears the CHEERING coming from the speakers. The water level stops rising but she still looks around in panic. KATE Noah! Where is he? Noah begins to cry. NOAH He was just behind me... Finally! Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull of wonderful air. Kate and Noah are overjoyed. The Pangs smile to one another. Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes. 123. JACKSON If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me. Kate embraces him tightly. KATE Whatever you do... I will never let you go again. Noah is all smiles. FADE TO BLACK 2013 We hear a voice. ADRIAN ... Day 988. No one is waiting for anything to happen... FADE UP The CAMERA moves over the last lines of Jackson's novel. INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian sits in his cabin, his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' in his lap. ADRIAN ... and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas. Opposite him, Laura sits listening to him read. ADRIAN ... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. The end. Adrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence. LAURA How many copies did you say that sold? 124. ADRIAN Less than 500. It's what you might call a cult classic. Laura looks at him grinning. LAURA It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley? ADRIAN Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements. LAURA Actually my diary's pretty open. The intimate moment is cut short. OFFICER Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian and Laura make their way to the bridge. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I will be giving the orders to unseal the decks. INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other people who are gathering in anticipation. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Please be careful when you step out and of course... enjoy the fresh air. Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket. She is holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar. LILLY Daddy? When can we go back home? 125. JACKSON There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared. LILLY I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups. JACKSON That's my big girl. Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder. OLEG Can we pet him? Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her. LILLY Of course you can. He's your doggie. The boys both smile at her. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian and Laura enter the bridge. ADRIAN You called for me, sir? CAPTAIN MICHAELS Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley. The Captain directs him to a monitor. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Looks like your scientific projections are way off again. The Captain grins at Prof. West. PROF. WEST The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian... A monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip is enlarged. LAURA What's that? 126. PROF. WEST It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Our European colleagues have already set course for it. Captain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Here, somebody wants to talk to you. Adrian curious, grabs the mic. ADRIAN This is Helmsley. We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY Harry Helmsley stands beside the cruise ship's Captain. VOICE No, this is Helmsley. ADRIAN Dad!... Is that you? INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian is ecstatic. Captain Michaels explains. CAPTAIN MICHAELS We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly. ADRIAN Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony? INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY Harry looks over at Tony who's listening, smiling. HARRY HELMSLEY He's fine, son. We're all fine. 127. ADRIAN See you guys soon. Bye dad. Harry hangs up. He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura and kisses her on the lips. She squeals. ANHEUSER Put that woman down Helmsley. Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say. ANHEUSER Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world... Adrian and Laura exchange a look. ANHEUSER I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours. Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave. ANHEUSER Mr. Helmsley, one more thing. Adrian turns back. ANHEUSER There was no one. ADRIAN Pardon me? ANHEUSER There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that. Anheuser puts out his hand. Adrian takes it. INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY CAPTAIN MICHAELS This is your Captain speaking. Standby to open Deck 1. OFFICER Standing by Sir. 128. Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband. MRS. PANG I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars? MR.PANG Do not fear. Some things will never change. The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah. JACKSON I thought you might want this. He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to him. NOAH Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad? Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them. ADRIAN I finally finished your book Jackson. KATE Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end. Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully. JACKSON Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think? Adrian smiles. ADRIAN I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole. Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd. Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to roll back and light streams in. 129. The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first rays of daylight hit their faces. EXT. AMERICAN SHIP/SOMEWHERE IN THE HIMALAYAS - DAY Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of day. A majestic moment. EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice- covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy. Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site-- The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak, surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most beautiful rainbow. This is the new world. And again we hear Mozart's Adagio... THE END\""
